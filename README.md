# MMDGenshin
Shader written for MMD to replicate the visual style of Genshin Impact

***

## How to use:
> Please see the wiki for this info
> <br> shader materials created for older versions of the shader will not work with this version. It is highly recommended that you remake them all together since this version of the shader is more accurate than the previous ones.
> <br> I will not provide any links or file downloads in this repository for texture or unity material files. You'll need to find those yourself. 
> <br> 

## Rules 
> - You may distribute your edited material files but do not repackage the entire original shader. That means only the .fx file you load into mmd or mmm should be shared.
> - If you use this shader, credit me clearly where people can easily see it.  You are not cool if you refuse to credit, youre not protecting some brand of yours... youre just being stupid 
> - You are free to use this as a reference for your own shaders but just like above, credit me where it will be easily seen.
